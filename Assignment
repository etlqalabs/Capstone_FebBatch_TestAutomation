1. Implement fixture to run at class level .i.e. once db connection is established, it will close
   only after all the test cases are executed - in all the stages

2. Implement remaining Data Transformation test cases ( 2 of the aggregators and 1 joiner test case )
   in test_DataTransfromation.py

3. In development project - create a python file that takes care of extract, transfrom and load.

4. In utils, add a function to verify if there are duplicates on a specific column

5. In test_DataQuality.py , implement these 4 test case for remaining files ( 3 )

6. Create 2 jobs:
   a) 1 for development and run all the etract, transform, load ( create a single job to take
   care of these 3 stage
   b) test job and ensure that successul build of dev job should trigger this test job
